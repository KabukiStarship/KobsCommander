***4*** Dive into the code!

All of the above APIs depend on [Script2](https://github.com/KabukiStarship/Script2), which is not working right now, so getting Script2 working is the most important task. After than all of the code in [ScriptTek](https://github.com/KabukiStarship/ScriptTek) and [KabukiToolkit](https://github.com/KabukiStarship/KabukiToolkit) have to get fixed. The GUI toolkit we're using is [Nuklear](https://github.com/Immediate-Mode-UI/Nuklear) and the core is getting swapped out with Script2 with Embedded-C++ bindings. We're then going to take a minimalist C++ graph plotting library and replace the core of that out with our Nuklear remake. For right now we're just going to use Nuklear as is to focus on IGeekCarWorld and IGeekWikiWorld and just update the code that we need to get started.
